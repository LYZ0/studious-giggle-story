Joe is an ordinary student. He goes to school everyday on time and is never 
late. He doesn't know what he wants to do in the future, and never think about
it seriously. He is neither short,nor tall. He is neither poor, nor well-being.
He isn't particularly smart either. He is so average in every thinkable way
that you would start to consider it an achievement.

Joe started to become concerned that his mediocrity was beginning to become a
burden on his life and those around him. Everywhere he went, people glanced at
him and immediately looked away, not out of disgust or fear, but out of
boredom. He set out to cure himself of his absolute lack of anything at all.

It started with a simple question he asked himself, "Who am I?", and 
he thought to himself, "I am Joe." Joe liked the answer to his own question.
"I am Joe" said nothing, yet everything at the same time. He gained confidence.
He started walking around school muttering "I am Joe" to himself. As each week 
progressed he proclaimed "I am Joe" louder and louder. 

"Shut up" said a student next to Joe. The student was looking at memes on their
phone, and it turns out that Joe's screaming was distracting. Joe didn't care,
his confidence had been pumped up to the point where the principal's detentions
for excessive noise did not seem to bother Joe at all. Some say that he is yelling
"I am Joe" today.
